Policy brief & purpose
Reading this travel policy means that you are part of the team that strives to build the best language learning app in the world, well done champ! ðŸ˜Ž

Being a remote company we sometimes need to get the team together to make some bad-ass decisions and have some FUN, which is the reason we have quarterly meetings with the team somewhere in the world aka Dropsites. In addition there might be some in-between traveling required for conferences etc to keep our minds fresh and up to date. 

If you thought packing was the hardest part while traveling, try managing the company travel! ðŸ¤¯Which is why this document has come to life - to make things easier for You and also for the management. 

The Drops travel and expense policy explains the rules for booking travel and managing expenses. This travel policy covers the rules for all business related travel: executive, employee and contractor.
