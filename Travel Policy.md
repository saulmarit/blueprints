# Policy brief & purpose


Reading this travel policy means that you are part of the team that strives to build the best language learning app in the world, well done champ! üòé

Being a remote company we sometimes need to get the team together to make some bad-ass decisions and have some FUN, which is the reason we have quarterly meetings with the team somewhere in the world aka Dropsites. In addition there might be some in-between traveling required for conferences etc to keep our minds fresh and up to date. 

If you thought packing was the hardest part while traveling, try managing the company travel! ü§ØWhich is why this document has come to life - to make things easier for You and also for the management. 

The Drops travel and expense policy explains the rules for booking travel and managing expenses. This travel policy covers the rules for all business related travel: executive, employee and contractor. 

The Drops travel policy helps us:

- Keep track of travelers‚Äô safety
- Promote fairness in business travel expenses
- Save time on manual tasks


Thank you for reading and following our policy! Please direct any questions to Marit (marit@languagedrops.com) üßö


# Elements & general guidelines


Travel expenses fall under two categories:

1. Expenses that are paid directly by the company on behalf of employees/service providers.
2. Expenses that are paid by the employees/service providers and are reimbursable. 


## Minimizing expenses

We‚Äôll reimburse all reasonable business expenses, after they are approved, in part or in full as the case may be BUT we want to avoid overspending or unnecessary costs. 
For example, we prefer booking plane tickets in economy class, unless there is reason for upgraded travel. 
We ask you to use your best judgment when traveling for company purposes. 


# 1. Company paid travel expenses


Travel expenses paid directly by the company include plane tickets, accommodation and also team meals or other expenses when possible during Dropsite. 

## Plane tickets ‚úàÔ∏è 

As of August 2019 we use [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/) for plane ticket purchases, here is a quick overview of the process:

- Please log into TravelPerk website or app with your languagedrops.com email address. 
- Use search for finding best value plane tickets. 
- Book your flight. 
- Pay for the booking using company card linked to TravelPerk.
- You may save your frequent flyer programs for use inside of TravelPerk and apply their program numbers at the time of booking.
- When finished you will get a confirmation letter to your email from TravelPerk.
- If you have any questions regarding the booking or your flight gets cancelled etc, please contact TravelPerk support, they are open 24/7. 

>NB! Please follow the check-in instroctions sent to your e-mail by TravelPerk for checking in!!

## Accommodation üõå

For accommodation we have previously used Airbnb-s but this might not be the case for every Dropsite. We will do the research and find suitable accommodation in the Dropsite location best suited our needs. For the accommodation  bookings we try to make bookings for you, so in most cases you do not have a say in where you would stay during the Dropsite. In some cases we ask you to make bookings for a certain apartment and then we will reimburse the cost. 

## Team meals during Dropsite üç≤

All whole team meals during Dropsites are covered and paid by the company (Marit). This usually covers lunches and at least 3 dinners but also breakfast in some cases, depending on the Dropsite location and program. 

## Other expenses during Dropsite üí∂

Other expenses during Dropsite, which may include taxi rides, optional dinners, free day programs etc. are covered by the company when prepayment is possible or when either Mark, Dani or Marit are present.

## Paying with company card üí≥

It might happen that You get the company card and are in charge of paying for the team. In case this happens please take good care of it and get a receipt or invoice for the payment, whichever is available. Usually you are given a receipt and a bank confirmation. For the accounting it is important to have the receipt with the paid sum and info (name, address) of the restaurant etc on it. You can scan the receipt and send it to invoices@languagedrops.com email with info about the cost (e.g team lunch) in a PDF format or just find Marit and give it to her. 


# 2. Reimbursable costs


All other expenses not stated in previous chapter are reimbursable. For reimbursements we use two options:

## Dropsite allowance üí∞

Starting from 2019 fall Dropsite we will introduce an allowance system for everyday costs during Dropsite. Before every Dropsite we will calculate the average daily cost and pay the allowance in advance for you to use during the trip. The allowance should cover taxi rides, food outside team meals, tickets, train rides etc. 

‚ùóThe allowance amount is without taxes so if you have to calculate employment taxes on that amount, then please add those to your invoice as well. 

## Other possible costs üßæ

This may include costs that fall outside the allowance, e.g transport to the airport, travel insurance etc. Upon approval also other costs during the trip that fall outside allowance. 

In this case also, please calculate the costs and add those to your invoice. 


# Dropsite knowledge base


We have team gatherings every quarter somewhere in the world. Mostly Europe but we keep the options open. As a remote team we use the Dropsite for work planning but also to have fun and bond as a team. 

The work part is related to having a whole team and smaller sessions on topics that are better to be discussed face-to-face as well as hold our BIG quarterly prioritisation session. The fun part can be spent together as a team doing touristy stuff or you can explore the destination solo as well.

By now we have developed a certain weekly plan that is a guideline for planning the trip. The week usually looks like this:

- We usually arrive at the destination two days earlier, meaning on Saturday

- The first day (Sunday) is free but we usually plan something for the whole team to take part in (doing touristy stuff etc.)

- Monday and Tuesday are for different sessions, whether it is whole team brainstorming or a small group developers session etc. On Monday there‚Äôs always a quarterly retro session - including celebrating our successes! -  and briefing about the weekly schedule.

- Wednesday is a free day to have some rest from the previous work marathon and prepare for the next two days of decision making and planning for the next quarter. You can have the day to yourself or team up with someone to plan a joint activity. The day usually ends with a house party of some sort in one of the airbnbs or a rented place. 

- Thursday and Friday are allocated for deciding what projects to take on in the new quarter.

- We have compulsory team dinners on Monday and Friday.


# Tips and tricks!


- When the schedule says optional, it means you have the freedom to choose! You do not have to attend optional days and events and you certainly do not have to feel bad about not attending!

- Be prepared that the week is exhausting and somewhat overwhelming so if in any point you feel like you wish to have some alone time, feel free to take a walk and clear your head, it is completely fine! 

- Enjoy the trip at your own pace but also respect others time and be on time to the official events. Which means that when your presence is required, be on time and ready to take part. When you have spare time, feel free to use it as you like to keep you happy and motivated throughout the week. 

- Feel free to take out some vacation days and extend your stay for a couple of days at the location (accommodation on you for these extra days).
